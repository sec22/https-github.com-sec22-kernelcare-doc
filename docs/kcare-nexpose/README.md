# Kcare-nexpose (deprecated)

:::warning Warning
This section is deprecated - refer to [Scanner Interface](/scanner_interface/) section for scanner-related information
:::


The script marks vulnerabilities detected by Nexpose, but patched by KernelCare as exceptions.

:::tip Note
If you are new in Nexpose, please read the [official documentation](https://nexpose.help.rapid7.com/docs/) on how to set up and operate.

## Installation


### From yum repository

To install kcare-nexpose, start with the minimal image of EL6:

```
$ cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/kcare-eportal.repo <<EOL
[kcare-eportal]
name=kcare-eportal
baseurl=http://repo.eportal.kernelcare.com/x86_64/
gpgkey=http://repo.cloudlinux.com/kernelcare-debian/6/conf/kcaredsa_pub.gpg
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
EOL
```

To install kcare-nexpose, run the command:

```
$ yum install kcare-nexpose
```

 
### From GitHub
 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudlinux/kcare-nexpose.git
$ cd kcare-nexpose/
$ python setup.py install
$ pip install -r REQUIREMENTS
```

## How It Works


The script finds CVEs that are related to patches applied by KernelCare (downloaded either from KernelCare ePortal or the central KernelCare patch server) and excludes them from Nexpose vulnerability scanner reports. The script can approve this exception in Nexpose (if you do not want to approve, set `is_approve` to `false` in the script config). It can also remove the old exceptions left from the previous script runs (set `delete_old` to `true` in the script config).

First, you should generate report in Nexpose (see supported report types below) and specify it in the config file. Also you need to specify some other [parameters](/kcare-nexpose/#yaml-config-file-description):

```
$ cp /usr/local/etc/kcare-nexpose.yml.template /usr/local/etc/kcare-nexpose.yml
$ vim /usr/local/etc/kcare-nexpose.yml
```

:::tip Note
IP address in Nexpose and the one in KernelCare ePortal should be the same. If you use Nexpose and KernelCare ePortal on different instances, you should make sure that Nexpose and KernelCare ePortal are not using localhost (127.0.0.1). Otherwise, kcare-nexpose can mark vulnerability wrong, as it just analyzes IP addresses from Nexpose and KernelCare ePortal. If used with CLN license server, the script can work with servers behind NAT by matching them by their hostnames.

### Supported report types

:::warning Note
Please make sure that you have configured a [site](https://nexpose.help.rapid7.com/docs/what-is-a-site) and a [scan](https://nexpose.help.rapid7.com/docs/selecting-a-scan-engine-for-a-site) before creating a report.
