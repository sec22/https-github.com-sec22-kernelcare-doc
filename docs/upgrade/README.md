# Upgrade


:::tip Note
How to upgrade from a ‘free patchset’ to a fully functional, paid KernelCare license
:::

If you installed our complementary Symlink Protection patchset and now would like to take advantage of the comprehensive kernel security updates without reboots that [KernelCare](https://www.kernelcare.com/) delivers, below describes how to do it.

Review our pricing page and purchase a license key [here](https://www.kernelcare.com/pricing/). If you already have a CLN account, you can purchase a plan by logging into [CLN](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/auth/login).

If you are using an IP-based license, nothing else is required and you are all set.

If you are using a key-based license, run:

```
$ /usr/bin/kcarectl --register KEY
```

To check if patches were applied, run:

```
$ /usr/bin/kcarectl --info
```

The software will automatically check for new patches every 4 hours, but if you would like to perform an update manually, run:

```
$ /usr/bin/kcarectl --update
```

:::tip Note
_Free_ patches are changed to _default_ now. If you still need symlink protection, you would need to apply _extra_ patches - they include symlink protection plus the security fixes for CentOS 6 and CentOS 7 (there are no extra charges for extra patches.
::: 

To enable extra patches and apply patch, run:

```
kcarectl --set-patch-type extra --update
```

To enable extra patches without update, run:

```
kcarectl --set-patch-type extra
```

The _extra_ patch will be applied on the next automatic update.

To see details, run:

```
kcarectl --patch-info
```
